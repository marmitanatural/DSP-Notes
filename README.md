#### DSP Notes
This repo contains a notebook which is used to store my DSP notes. I intend for the notes to be self contained, so that someone with no knowledge of physics, engineering or DSP could read it and learn enough to start doing basic DSP in Python or data science projects involving audio. Topics covered include:
- Signals
- Fourier series, Fourier transforms, discrete Fourier transforms and the fast Fourier transform algorithm
- Convolution & other important operations in DSP
- Finite & infinite impulse response filters
- 

 Presupposing some knowledge of C++/JUCE this would in principle be enough of an introduction to do some
